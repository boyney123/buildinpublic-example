<Event icon="VideoCameraIcon" date="17 May 2021" title="100 Early Subscribers Milestone in 10 days! ðŸŽ‰">
    <p>Happy to share with everyone yesterday night we hit the 100 early subscribers milestone which was awesome!</p>
    <p>To reach 100 I have shared content on Twitter, left comments in reddit, joined discord channels and even created our own discord channel (come join)!</p>
    <p>I also released a new video showcasing the new code block, how to move blocks around and a quick intro into themes</p>
    <EventVideo url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rimFEf5grGk" />
    <p>Super happy with the progress, still a fair amount to do, but it's coming along nicely.</p>
