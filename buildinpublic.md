<Event icon="MailIcon" date="17 May 2021" title="100 Early Subscribers Milestone in 10 days! ðŸŽ‰" animate="false">
    <p>Happy to share with everyone yesterday night we hit the 100 early subscribers milestone which was awesome!</p>
    <p>To reach 100 I have shared content on Twitter, left comments in reddit, joined discord channels and even created our own discord channel (come join)!</p>
    <p>I also released a new video showcasing the new code block, how to move blocks around and a quick intro into themes</p>
    <EventVideo url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rimFEf5grGk" />
    <p>Super happy with the progress, still a fair amount to do, but it's coming along nicely.</p>
    <p>If you want a landing page for your GitHub project, then sign up for early access and be part of this community!</p>

<Event icon="MailIcon" date="16 May 2021" title="Almost at 100 Subscribers after 1 week! ðŸŽ‰">
    <p>Find it amazing what you can do if you write a list and focus on getting small incremental value done, also feels like progress being made on Gitpages.</p>
    <p>Almost at 100 subs for early access which has been great, although I expect it to slow down abit now as I have tried most channels ( I can think of ) to tell people about gitpages for now. (reddit, linkedin etc).</p>
    <p>Getting some good feedback on the project, but question is will anyone be interested in the sponsorware idea. Time will tell.</p>
    <p>Enjoying working on the project, with so many ideas it is hard to focus on the value, but think thats going OK, for now...</p>

<Event icon="VideoCameraIcon" date="13 May 2021" title="78 Subscribers, 574 visits">
    
  <p>Gitpages.app has had 574 visits so far to the website, and 78 people have signed up for early access, which I think is pretty good.</p>

  <p>Looks like the idea might be resonating with people around so let's see if that continues as I continue to write the project.</p>

  <p>Made some great progress this week with the project and got it to a place I can easily add new blocks, so now I'm just focusing on a blocks and then documentation for the early subscribers.</p>

  <p>Also started to embed in communities and getting some good feedback.</p>

  <p>Waiting for 100 subscribers, would be epic if we made it this week!</p>

<Event icon="VideoCameraIcon" date="11 May 2021" title="55 Subscribers to Early Access and New Design">
    
  <p>Wow, 1 day after I set the goal for 50 subscribers for early access I managed to get 55!</p>

  <p>Seems that Gitpages might help a few people out after all.</p>

  <p>I spent some time redesigning the website and logo check it out! Let me know what you think.</p>

  <p>Next milestones:</p>

  <ol className="list-disc pl-8">
    <li>100 early subscribers</li>
    <li>Getting more blocks built for Gitpages</li>
    <li>Get more examples in the showcase on the website</li>
  </ol>

</Event>

<Event icon="VideoCameraIcon" date="10 May 2021" title="First weekly video released!">

  <p>Had a thought to share with people on video how things are going, hopefully weekly.</p>
  <p>I managed to pull together this video (pretty new at this stuff), but hopefully showcases the kind of work I'm doing and how much I believe GitPages will benefit the world....who knows!</p>

<Event icon="MailIcon" date="10 May 2021" title="32 subscribers to early access - Wow!">

  <p>Two days after I git 10 subscribers, we shot up to 32 subscribers!</p>

  <p>I have continued to share the project around and continued to see more traffic to the website.</p>

  <p>Getting some good feedback from the idea, and it seems to be coming across well.</p>

  <p>Started to work on MVP more and getting the basics setup ready to build blocks for landing pages quickly.</p>

  <p>We have had about 230 visitors so far, so its over 10% sign up rate, which is great.</p>

  <p>Happy with how its going, the next milestone will be 50 subs!</p>

<Event icon="MailIcon" date="08 May 2021" title="10 subscribers to early access!">

  <p>Using Mailchimp and having a landing page, I started to share the project around on socials, reddit and talking to people.</p>

  <p>My aim was to get 10 subscribers in a week, but managed to get it on the first day!</p>

  <p>Happy with the result, now next milestone will be 25!</p>

<Event icon="LightBulbIcon" date="05 May 2021" title="Come up with the idea for Gitpages.app">

  <p>I was building other open-source projects and building landing pages for them. The landing pages I enjoy but take a fair amount of time. I noticed in the past that projects with landing pages tend to get a bit more traction, and I started to wonder if other people would have similar outcomes?</p>

  <p>I started to wonder if there was a quick tool for engineers to use to create landing pages from GitHub projects, a tool that would take seconds to use.... I couldnt find anything, started to hack around and before I know it I get something working!</p>

  <p>Grabbed the notepad and started to draw some ideas down.</p>
